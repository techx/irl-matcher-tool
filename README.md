IRL Matcher
==

To foster a sense of community within TechX, we want to have a system of random lunch matches so that people across the organization can get to know one another. People have tough availability constraints and preferences over the kinds of people they want to meet, so assigning lunch dates is a challenging optimization problem. This tool helps a human perform that task.

## Development

This tool is totally client side. Run it with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or something.
