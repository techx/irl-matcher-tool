IRL Matcher
==

To foster a sense of community within TechX, we want to have a system of random lunch matches so that people across the organization can get to know one another. People have tough availability constraints and preferences over the kinds of people they want to meet, so assigning lunch dates is a challenging optimization problem. This tool helps a human perform that task.

## Usage

1. Go to the IRL spreadsheet produced by the google form.
2. `Ctrl+a` to select all.
3. `Ctrl+c` to copy the raw cells.
4. Go to the site, at http://irl.techx.io.
5. Paste the raw spreadsheet data into the text box.
6. Click names to gray them out, indicating that you've manually matched them!

## Development

This tool is totally client side. Run it with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or something.
